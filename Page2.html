 <h1 style="color:red">The Ultimate Spider-Man</h1>

 <p style="color:red">Miles Morales is a teenager from Brooklyn who was bitten by a Genetically Altered Spider and became Earth-1610's Spider-Man following the supposed death of that reality's Peter Parker.

After the Multiverse was destroyed and subsequently rebuilt, Miles Morales, along with his friends and family, were transported to Earth-616 and rewritten into that world's history.</p>
